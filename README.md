# vita-vn-ocr

A tiny Japanese OCR made only for visual-novel dialogue on PS Vita and PSP. It is meant to run on the console itself, inside [vita-jp-overlay](https://github.com/bee-san/vita-jp-overlay), in as little memory as possible.

General OCR models are too big for this. The best general option, a trimmed int8 PP-OCRv5 mobile, still peaks at about 13 MiB (see `docs/research-findings.md`). VN dialogue is a much narrower problem: one or a few horizontal lines in a dialogue box, a handful of game fonts, and a fixed screen size (960×544 on Vita, 480×272 on PSP). A recognizer trained only for that case can be an order of magnitude smaller.

## Status

| | |
|---|---|
| Model | `train/model.py`: a CTC line recognizer with 0.76M parameters (stem plus depthwise-separable blocks, factorised 5,355-class head), grey input at height 32 |
| v1 baseline | Trained on synthetic dialogue boxes only. Synthetic validation: 0.34% CER, 95.6% of lines exact (`docs/v1-metrics.jsonl`). Real Vita screenshots (`eval/`, vita-test, 206 lines from 16 games): 23.75% CER, 52.4% exact, 81.8% CER on its 43 dark-on-light lines. Real PSP screenshots (psp-test, 245 lines from 14 games): 46.45% CER, 30.2% exact, 86.8% CER on its 110 dark-on-light lines (`docs/results.md`). |
| Runtime | `runtime/`: plain-C99 recognizer for Vita (NEON) and PSP (scalar), no malloc, 116-125 KB arena at any line width; int8 weights 0.86 MB (`runtime/README.md`) |
| Hardware | Nothing has run on a PCH-1000 or a PSP yet |

## Layout

```
setup_env.sh, requirements.*   Python env (uv; CPU torch)
data/fetch_assets.py           OFL fonts, Aozora/Wikipedia text, VNDB screenshot list
data/label_real.py             first real-line pseudo-labeller (PP-OCRv5 server + manga-ocr agreement)
realdata/                      real training lines from Vita, PSP and scaled PC screenshots (4-reader vote)
data/vocab.txt                 output character set

## Data policy

Game screenshots, rendered shards, downloaded corpora, fonts and checkpoints stay local and are **never committed**. Screenshots are copyrighted game images. The repo holds code, manifests, small derived tables such as `vocab.txt`, and results. Model weights are published as release assets.

## Setup
